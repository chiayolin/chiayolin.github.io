  I'm Chiayo, and this is my website. I'm a Taiwanese who grew up
  in Saigon (HCMC), Vietnam. I'm currently an undergrad student at the
  University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a degree in
  Computer Science.

<p>
  You can find both of my email address and PGP key (in case you'd like
  to be extra paranoid) in the footer of this page.
</p>
<p>I like to cycle, study world history, and
  <a href="https://github.com/chiayolin">write software</a>.</p>
