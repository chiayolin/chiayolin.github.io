<p>Xin Chào! My name is 林 (ハヤシ) 佳佑, pronouced "Lin Chiayo", "Lim Kaiu", or
"Hayashi Keisuke", depending on where you come from since Formosa (Taiwan) is a
country of immigrants. I was born in Taiwan so am 100% Taiwanese, lived in
Vietnam in the beautiful Saigon, and now ended up in the United States at the
University of Maryland (College Park), pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
<p>My email address and PGP key (in case you'd like to be extra paranoid) are both
in the footer of this page.</p>

<h3>Fun fact!</h3>
<p>In case you are wondering, I did not make the logo for this website, it came
from a historic department store in Tainan, Formosa (Taiwan), opened in 1932
called the <a href="http://www.hayashi.com.tw/page.asp?nsub=A8A000&lang=E">
Hayashi Department Store (林 "ハヤシ" 百貨)</a>. It was damaged during air raids
by the US in WWII, occupied by the ROC post-war, and fianlly reopened 69 years
later in 2014.</p>

<p>IMCOMPLETE...</p>
