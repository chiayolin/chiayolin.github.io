<p>Xin Chào. My name is 林佳佑, which romanized to  "Lin Chiayo", "Lim Kaiu", or
"Hayashi Keisuke." I was born in Taipei, Taiwan (Formosa), grew up in HCMC
(Saigon), Vietnam. I'm currently in the United States at the University of
Maryland, College Park, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My email address and PGP key (in case you'd like to be extra paranoid) are both
in the footer of this page.</p>
