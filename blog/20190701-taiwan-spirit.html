<p><em>Last Thoughts on Taiwanese Politics (at least for now)</em></p>

<p>This article is going to be my last article on Taiwanese politics in a very long
time. I have recently decided to dedicate all my time to Computer Science, since
specializing in the field of computing has been the purpose of my life.
However, this does not mean I will stop caring about my home, Taiwan. Fighting
for Taiwan's independence has been the long-term objective of many Taiwanese.
Furthermore, persistence is one of the traits that defines the Taiwanese people:
So no matter how many of us were killed, after how many centuries, we will not
stop fighting against the Chinese imperialism.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Empire of Japan lost Taiwan as its territory during the Republic of China
(= ROC)’s occupation of Taiwan after WWII in 1951. ROC occupation of Taiwan led
a forty-year period (= 1947-1987) of coercive Sinicization known as White Terror
by destroying the Taiwanese identity through committing systematic massacres.
The People’s Republic of China (= PRC), on the other hand, is taking advantage
of the political situation of Taiwan and seek to utilize a pseudo-
“reunification” with Taiwan to extenuate a genocidal invasion against the
Formosans. Therefore, I propose to consider that Taiwan must de-Sinicize through
strengthening the sense of Taiwanese Nationalism in order to avert the ultimate
Chinese genocidal conquest of abject brutality.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Many historians have failed to recognize the fact that Taiwan and China are
essentially different. However, these misconceptions must be addressed before
any further conversations. Common misconceptions include the false beliefs that
Formosa (= Taiwan) is a part of China and that Formosans are Chinese
(Lin et al). The modern term “Chinese” refers to a collection of ethnicities
from a nation of an artificially-defined region called “China.” More precisely,
it is the evolution of a civilization formed by an ethnic group called “Han”
originated in the Yellow River basin (Bagley 124-231).</p>

<p>The biggest <strong>minority</strong> group in Taiwan are ethnic Chinese, making up 15% of
Taiwan’s population (Jacobs et al 392): They fled to Taiwan post-WWII with the
US support after being defeated by the PRC. The other 85% of the Taiwanese
population is the admixture of the descendants of Ban-Oat (also known as
“Man-Viet” or “Min-Yueh”) and Native Formosans of Austronesian origins, thus
genetically differ from Han Chinese in Beijing (= CHB), according to
phylogenetic trees constructed with HLA data (Jacobs et al 392, Lin et al
192-199, and Lynch 569).</p>

<p>Ban-Oat was an extinct indigenous tribe inhabited modern-day Fujian from a
non-Chinese ethnic group of Pah-Oat (also known as “Bach-Viet” in Vietnamese or
“Bai-Yueh” in Mandarin) whom Han considered barbarous (Chang). Pah-Oat people
migrated to Southeast Asia and/or Formosa during Han’s Southward Expansion
around 100 BC (Marks 127 and Meacham). Other tribes of Pah-Oat, such as Au-Viet
and Lac-Viet, became the ancestors for modern-day Vietnamese (Hashimoto 1).
It is believed that Ban-Oat people assimilated into the Austronesians on Formosa
and became the Plains Formosans (Lin et al 192-199).</p>

<p>In the 16th century, Japanese merchants and pirates founded immigrant villages
collectively known as Takasago as well as the Europeans later on in the 17th
century (Kerr 24). The half-Japanese of Ban-Oat origin pirate, Koxinga, defeated
the Europeans and founded some more permanent settlements on Formosa (Ong, A
Formosan’s View 197 and Kerr 26). In 1683, the Chinese started a two-century-
long unsuccessful and abusive attempt to rule Formosa but only managed to
control one-third of it (Kerr 26). In 1895, Chinese was defeated by the Empire
of Japan under Emperor Meiji, liberating Formosans from the abusive Chinese rule
(Kerr 26, 27). Formosans began the journey of unification and modernization
under the Empire of Japan and avoided most of the important developments in
Chinese history (Lynch 561).</p>

<p>After WWII, the ROC occupied Formosa under Allies’ General Headquarters (= GHQ)
(Kerr 96). As a result, Japan lost Taiwan as its territory in 1951. Moreover,
the international status of Taiwan remains undecided (Jacobs et al 391) — It is
important to understand that Formosa in its entirety has never been part of
China whatsoever. The post-war occupation of Formosa led to a period of coercive
Sinicization known as White Terror (1947-1987) (Lynch 570 and Kerr 254-341).
During White Terror, the occupying ROC implemented a colonial-style system where
the ethnic Taiwanese, who made up 85% of Taiwan’s population, were treated as
second-class citizens, excluded from any effective voices in the government for
not being Chinese, and subjected to systematic massacres (Jacobs et al 377 and
Kerr 10, 254-341). ROC also attempted to replace Formosan cultures with the
ridiculous glorification of China and Chinese culture as well as prohibited the
Taiwanese to speak Taiwanese and Japanese, hoping to root out the Formosan
identity (Lynch 565 and Kerr 7). Taiwanese people were helpless after WWII — The
United States supported the brutal Chinese occupation while Japan was impotent
with the defeat (Ong, A Formosan’s View 109).</p>

<h3>Resolution</h3>

<p>Although Taiwan democratized in 1988, the ill effects of coercive Sinicization
under the foreign regime of ROC, which continues to occupy Taiwan as of 2019,
have come to threaten Taiwan’s economy, identity, and security. Moreover, the
increasing aggression from PRC towards Taiwan shows the Chinese are taking
advantage of Taiwan’s political situation and seek to utilize a pseudo-
“reunification” with the occupying ROC regime on Taiwan to extenuate an invasion
against the Taiwanese (Kerr 12, McNamara 50, and Lee, Understanding Taiwan 10).
Therefore, the evolutionary emergence of the Taiwanese nationalism shall then be
utilized to intensify the de-Sinicization of Taiwan. I will first discuss why
there is a need to de-Sinicize the education system of Taiwan. Secondly, I will
discuss the normalization of the government of Taiwan and the eventual fate of
the occupying ROC. Finally, I will address the problem and solution to
de-Sinicizing Taiwan’s economy.</p>

<h3>De-Sinicize Taiwan's Education</h3>

<p>In the Book of Exodus of the Old Testament, there is a part where it says the
Israelites may only return to Canaan when they have established their identity
as Israelites through undergoing a spiritual reform by following the Ten
Commandments (Exodus 20). Additionally, the exodus would not have been possible
if the Israelites decided to remain enslaved by the Egyptian due to the
difficulties along the journey to freedom (16:3). Dr. Teng-Hui Lee, the
first ethnic Taiwanese president of the ROC who democratized the dictatorial
regime, suggests that the Taiwanese people face a similar situation as the
Israelites in the Exodus, too (Jacobs et al 383). Dr. Lee expresses in his
papers as well as an interview aired in Japan, that a mere political reform of
Taiwan is insufficient (Lee, Understanding Taiwan 13, Jacobs 383, and Shirai 1
6:09). Instead, a spiritual reform must take place in order to restore the
“Spirit of Taiwan” or “Taiwanese identity,” after half-a-century of coercive
Sinicization under the dictatorial ROC regime after WWII (Shirai 18:10).
However, a comprehensive spiritual reform of Taiwan is not possible when the
education system is hijacked by the Chinese conqueror as the instrument for
Sinicization (Kerr 9, Shirai 17:59, and Lynch 566).</p>

<p>Although the education system in Taiwan has been <strong>incrementally Taiwanized</strong>
under the succeeding ethnic Taiwanese President, Mr. “A-Bian” Tan in the 2000s
(Sullivan), the legacies from the period of coercive Sinicization under the
still-occupying ROC are still affecting the education until today (Kerr 9).
Therefore, an education reformation must take place in order to completely
de-Sinicize the public education system. Such reformation includes but not
limited to the elimination of Sino-centric thoughts in the textbooks as well as
the teachers who deliver the content. Dr. Lee and Dr. Lok-Tek Ong, a scholar of
Taiwanese studies in the Tokyo Imperial University, both reiterate the urgency
for the Taiwanese people to study Formosan history from the Formosan-centric
perspective and utilize these bits of knowledge as the foundation for the
present and a guide to the future (Ong, A Formosan’s View 107-114, Ong, 1973
WFTA Speech 5:22, and Shrai 18:55). The reformation of the education system
through de-Sinicization as a way to intensify the restoration of the lost
Taiwanese identity, will then the Taiwanese people rediscover the “Spirit of
Taiwan.”</p>

<h3>De-Sinicize Taiwan's Government</h3>

<p>The spiritual reformation of Taiwan through de-sinicizing the public education
system under the occupying ROC enables the majority of Taiwanese youths to
identify realistically with Taiwan by default, instead of a fictional
“motherland” purposefully utilized as an instrument for colonization to distort
the realistic Taiwanese identity (Shirai 18:00, Ong, 1973 WFTA Speech 4:52, and
Kerr ). Regardless the order of which this spiritual reformation is achieved,
sooner or later, the people of Taiwan will eventually encounter a more radical
political reformation, that is, the abolition of the occupying ROC (Kerr 12).
The Declaration of Independence of 1776 conveys the immortal idea that
“governments are instituted among the people, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed” (Jefferson). But again, the current government of
Taiwan operates upon the Constitution of ROC — The people of Taiwan were forced
into this “social contract” with the ROC regime upon the end of WWII by coercive
and even genocidal means, which is evidently destructive to the “inalienable
rights” of the people (Jefferson and Locke). Accordingly, Taiwanese shall “alter
and abolish” the ROC. Furthermore, the abolition of ROC shall be viewed as an
exercise of the right to self-determination as well as to defend the natural
rights of the people (Jefferson).</p>

<p>That being said, the situation of Taiwan is far more complicated than this.
Multiple sources have pointed out the fact that the PRC is seeking to take
advantage of the political situation of Taiwan, through utilizing a
pseudo-“reunification” with Taiwan to extenuate what is essentially the Chinese
neo-imperial expansion (Lee, Understanding Taiwan 10, McNamara 48, Jacobs 386,
Lynch 567, and Kerr 12). Particularly, Lynch and Kerr in their papers compared
the situation of Taiwan with other victims of Chinese neo-imperial expansion
such as Tibetans, Uighurs and Mongols (567, 12). Besides, Taiwanese have already
experienced systematic massacres under the ROC regime after WWII (Lynch 567).
Now taking the PRC genocidal records in Tibet and Uyghur into account, it is
obvious that so-called “reunification” is but an excuse for a genocidal invasion
against the non-Chinese people in the Chinese neo-imperial expansion (Lynch 567
and Kerr 12). Disturbingly, the Chinese will then proceed to force the
international community to accept the fiction that these people being massacred
are “Chinese” and their ancestral lands have been the “inseparable parts of
China” (Hass and Haynes).</p>

<p>In the past decades, China has been using every opportunity to isolate Taiwan
from the international community, fantasizing to turn the fiction that Taiwan
is a part of China into reality (Jacobs et al 380 and Lee, Understanding Taiwan
10, 12). However, Taiwan is the only one among the countries which China claimed
to be its territory but managed to resist the Chinese neo-imperial invasion
(Lynch 567). One may argue that the democratization of Taiwan in 1988 made such
resistance possible since the power was restored to the people of  Taiwan. As
Dr. Lee states in his book, “I felt the Taiwan people must truly possess
sovereignty before they can develop their will for freedom and create their
future” (Lee, The Road to Democracy 99). Additionally, the United State’s Taiwan
Relation Act of 1979 established the basis for maintaining the security of the
people of Taiwan as well as another post-war ally of the US such as Japan
(Moore 24). Furthermore, the emerging Taiwanese nationalism also sends out a
clear signal that Taiwanese people are willing to defend Taiwan to death, which
may deter the willingness to invade since the potential cost may be too high to
take over Formosa (Bush).</p>

<h3>De-Sinicize Taiwan's Economy</h3>

<p>The economy is a key aspect to consider in the process of de-Sinicization.
Another crucial step to de-Sinicize Taiwan is to diversify its export markets.
Chinese market accounted for 19%, 23%, and 27% of Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan’s total exports respectively (International Trade Centre). From the
economics perspective, over-reliance on a single export market is unhealthy to
a country’s economy since a shift in demand of that market will cause a
significant change, either positive or negative, on the country’s capital-inflow
due to a component of GDP calculation: net-exports (Williamson). The capital
inflow of an economy affects the real GDP in the short run and the economic
growth in the long run (Maley et al 523). Developing economic dependency on the
Chinese market is particularly harmful to Taiwan. The obvious reason is that
unlike Taiwan’s free-market economy, China’s economy is mostly controlled by the
state (Lee, Understanding Taiwan 13). Therefore, the Chinese government may
utilize such dependency as an instrument to exert its political agenda against
Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Chinese government further prompted economic integration with Taiwan
by providing Taiwanese businesses such as Foxconn Technology and Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (= TSMC) strategic benefits such as tax
reduction to open up factories (National People's Congress). Although setting up
factories in China may be beneficial to private businesses due to lower tax and
labor costs, it is essentially a capital-outflow to Taiwan (Maley et al 523).
These capital-outflows not only destroy Taiwan’s vital comparative advantage,
but they will also ultimately be used by China to finance the war against Taiwan
(Jacobs et al 387). The Chinese government may then exploit these businesses and
make them the bargaining chips with Taiwan over politics. These private
companies may potentially influence the Taiwanese Parliament when it comes to
policy-making (Garun and Kawase). Furthermore, Taiwanese world-leading
technology companies such as TSMC and MediaTek possess advanced technologies on
semiconductor design and fabrication as well as talents in this field. Moving
these factories to China will put these technologies which the Taiwanese devoted
a considerable amount of capital into research and development under the threat
of intellectual-property-theft from Chinese business spies (Hruska and Horton).
That being said, Taiwan shall instead move the capitals to other emerging
economies in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam or India who share no direct
political conflicts but have China as the common competitor (Shah 15).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>A de-Sinicized public education system enables the future-generation Taiwanese
to understand Taiwan from Taiwan’s perspective, identify with Taiwan instead of
the conqueror’s fictional ”motherland,” and together create a sense of Taiwanese
Nationalism which may eventually lead to the creation of an independent nation
under the name of Taiwan, through abolishing the occupying ROC. Furthermore,
Taiwanese shall learn from the island's past — Remember the corruption and
immorality of a Chinese regime (Ong, A Formosan’s View 108). Restore the
efficiency and honesty established under the Japanese regime (108). And pave the
forward path for the creation of a future independent nation which shares the
same democratic values with the free world. Finally, this independent nation
shall ultimately terminate the cycle of repeated conquests and massacres against
the Formosans. Moreover, the democratization of Taiwan shall enable the
Taiwanese people a normal channel to establish this independent nation while
sustaining the existing complex and advanced economy of the country. However,
let no one underestimate China’s intention to take advantage of the political
situation of Taiwan.</p>
