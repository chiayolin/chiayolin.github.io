<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> <em>This post is an English adaptation of
Taiwan Tati Cultural and Educational Foundation's <a href="http://taiwantt.org.tw/taiwanspirit/frame/frame35.htm">article</a> on Han Bok Ki and
a pilot for the "2/28 Series". The hope is to translate their historical notes
on Formosan intellectuals murdered by the ROC in the 2/28 Massacre
(and White Terror) into English, making this dark hidden side of post-WWII
Formosan history accessible to the world, in case some Chinese dickheads in the
future try to erase or deny the crimes and genocide they have committed
against the Taiwanese.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Han ("Phuann Bo̍k Ki" / 潘木枝) was born in Kagi (modern-day Chiayi, Taiwan),
graduated from Tokyo Medical University, and spent three years in Tokyo Hasegawa
Hospital. He started a hospital in Kagi called “Mukaisei” when he returned to
Taiwan (Formosa) in 1935. After the Second World War in 1946, Han won the Kagi
City Council Election in the Allied (ROC) Occupied Formosa as a
representative with the most votes, regardless he spent much of his time
looking after his patients back in the hospital during the election.</p>

<p>Responding to the 2/28 Massacre committed by the ROC, Han along with a
total of 12 Formosans, went to Kagi Airbase, on behalf of the Settlement
Committee, hoping to negotiate with the ROC Military trapped inside the
airbase by the Kagi Militia. However, all were captured by the ROC
during the negotiation, later executed in front of the Kagi Station on
March 25th, 1947.</p>

<p>A local old gentleman in Kagi said in an interview, "Han was a nice guy,
he provided free medical assistance to ones who were too poor to afford."
The old gentleman then recalled "Han used to say, 'when a patient gives
his life to me, it doesn’t matter if the patient can afford or not, it is
but my responsibility to fulfill my duty as a doctor.'"</p>

<p>Han valued lives, especially the young ones. During the 2/28 Massacre, many
students from Kano College and Kagi High School wanted to take over the
Kagi Airbase from the ROC. Han urged the students not to act so recklessly,
else they would just be wasting their lives. Unfortunately, these young,
educated, and brave students were murdered by ROC soldiers with machine guns
next to the fountain at Nanmon-chō, Kagi, on the way to the airbase. Han was
very upset about the deaths of these Formosan students.</p>

<p>A Taiwanese Presbyterian Pastor in Kagi recollected from his memories, "Han
and the Formosans captured during the negotiation with ROC thought they
would at least have a fair and public trial at the court. However, Han
learned he was about to be executed only when a guard smuggled a cigarette
box and told him to write his last words on it, and he promised to deliver
the message to his wife."</p>

<p>Formosans who grew up in Japanese Taiwan like Han were inspired by the modern
concept of the rule of laws, and a fair judicial system. Many Formosans at the
time could not believe that a human being could be executed without a fair trial.
In Han’s and many others’ cases, there were no trials at all.  After Han’s
execution, his body was left in front of the station for many days. His boots
were stolen by a ROC soldier watching the site.</p>

<p>People who knew Han all came to commemorate him by offering incense sticks after
learning about his death regardless they might also get killed. One of his seven
children was beaten to death when hiding in Mt. Arisan. These barbaric tragedies
that the Formosans went through shall remind the world about the abject brutality
of the Chinese regime.</p>
