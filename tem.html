    <h2>Hello, World</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>Written by Chiayo Lin | Nov 12, 1999<p><br/>
    <p>But I must <b>explain</b> to you how all this <i>mistaken</i> idea of
     denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will 
     give you a complete account of the system, and expound the 
     actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the 
     master-builder of human happiness.</p>
    <p><span class="tab"/>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
      because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
      know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
      consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is 
      there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
      of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally 
      circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him 
      some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us 
      ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to 
      obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to 
      find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that 
      has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that 
      produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
