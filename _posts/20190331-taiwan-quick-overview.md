*Background and Motivation: An Unwanted Encounter*

“Where are you from?”, She asked. I was in a public space,
and a Chinese student moved near me. I replied, “Oh I'm Taiwanese, how about
yo…” Without waiting for my sentence to finish, she responded, “Taiwan is
[a part of] China. You are Chinese.” So I sighed. This rather peculiar and
unwanted experience is something Formosans everywhere have to deal with.

### History TL;DR: Formosa has never been part of China

Formosa has been a critical spot for international trade and politics because
it lies in the maritime world embracing the Pacific Rim. Early Chinese records
before 15th century suggest that Formosa was inhabited by non-Chinese
“barbarians” and there were no Chinese attempts to found settlements. Japanese
merchants and pirates founded the first immigrant villages collectively known
as Takasago on Formosa. Then came the Dutch and Spanish in the early half of
the 16th century. Later a mixed fleet of Japanese pirates and Ming outlaws
defeated the Europeans and founded more permanent settlements. Starting from
1683, Ch’ing sent garrison forces and started a two-century-long unsuccessful
and abusive attempt to rule the island but only managed to control one-third of
Formosa in reality. In 1895, Ch’ing was defeated by the Empire of Japan,
liberating Formosans from the abusive Ch’ing rule. Formosans began the journey
of unification and modernization under the Empire of Japan. In conclusion,
Formosa in its entirety has never been part of China whatsoever.

### We are Formosans - We are not (nor wish to become) Chinese

Two major recurring themes are revealed in the small conversation I had with
a Chinese person, that among them are, the false-perception that Formosa is
part of China and the Chinese is trying to take advantage of the political
situation of Taiwan. The island of Formosa was occupied by the US Ally, the
Republic of China (ROC) upon the surrender of WWII. Therefore, the
international status of Formosa is undecided after Japan renounces Formosa in
the Treaty of San Francisco of 1951. The ROC maintained a discriminatory
policy against Formosans during the forty-year period of brutal martial law
known as White Terror (1947-1987), hoping to root out the Formosan identity.
In addition to committing systematic massacres, the ROC prohibited the
Formosans to speak Taiwanese and Japanese, attempted to replace the Formosan
cultures by the glorification of China and Chinese culture. The de-facto
colonial institution, the ROC, is still occupying Formosa as of 2019 and its
legacy have come to affect every aspect of Formosans’ lives, such as education,
economy, and national identity. On the other hand, we the people of Formosa are
not nor wish to become Chinese. The increasing aggression from the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) hoping to invade Taiwan also shows the Chinese is
taking advantage of the political situation of Taiwan by using “reunifying with
the ROC” as an excuse.
