I'm writing this article just to document the event that happened recently and to
provide my perspective of this particular incident.

Earlier this month, my friend, let's call him *Bob*, was warned that an allegation
he made regarding *something* against a civil servant of Taiwan's *Ministry
of Foreign Affairs* could possibly constitute defamation. Such act is but a typical
method and excuse the government officials constantly use to prevent the people from
discussing and investigating the truth. Later on, he was even forced to answer
questions asked by entities that are not entitled to the power to investigate.
Conducting an investigation without the police power endowed by the Constitution is
unconstitutional. Furthermore, the allegation he made is protected by the freedom of
speech and is guaranteed by *Article 11* of the Taiwanese (ROC) Constitution.

In the **[Constitutional Interpretation No. 509][ie]**（釋〔憲〕字第五〇九號）published
in July 7th 2000, *Constitutional Court of Judicial Yuan*（司法院・憲法庭）reiterates
the fact that the freedom of speech guaranteed by *Article 11* is a fundamental right:

	「言論自由為人民之基本權利」

Thus the government is obligated to grant a maximum amount of protection for free
speech:

	「國家應給予最大限度之維護」

**No. 509** further states that as long as the person has reasonable
grounds to believe that the statement is true, that person must be found not guilty of
criminal defamation:

	「認為行為人有相當理由確信其為真實者，即不能以誹謗罪之刑責相繩」

The law of defamation is supposed to protect the reputation of a natural person but it
is often abused by politicians so people will avoid discussing certain topics. This is
wrong because a democratic institution is based upon open discussions and the system
will fail to operate if the freedom of expression is taken away. Although there are
*some people* who want to sue *Bob* for defamation, *Bob* will not be found guilty
since his rights are protected by the Constitution and his situation is compatible with
**No. 509**. We shall view this incident as nothing more than an exercise of rights.
