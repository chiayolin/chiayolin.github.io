```
  紅の雲明け行くを 笑まひ見つ 曉闇よ我が屍抱け

  — 何川 絕命詩 (紀元 2611 年)
```

This is a poem (in Japanese) a Taiwanese wrote before he was executed by the ROC
in 1951, during the Allied Occupation of Formosa, where the ROC committed a
brutal genocide against the Formosans. We shall remember the abject brutality
of the Chinese regime, else soon there will be another attempt by the Chinese
to eradicate the Formosans from Formosa.

I don't know how to translate an haiku but here is an attempt anyway with some
fabrication:

```
  The crimson clouds at the break of dawn
  Looking up at the sky with a faint smile
  Hold my cold remains with your warm arms
```
