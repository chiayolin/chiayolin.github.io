It has been almost a year since I last stayed in a room at New World. Before that, I was a long-term resident of New World Saigon Hotel since 2014. However, we had to relocate to another hotel mid-2020 as the business was heavily affected by the global pandemic, although Vietnam’s containment of the virus within the country has been magnificent.

Just a few days before 2021, I decided to go back to the hotel for a weekend getaway to celebrate the New Year and to re-visit some old memories over there. Unsurprisingly, the price for a room/night in New Year was relatively inexpensive compared to pre-pandemic. That being said, if you pay for the most affordable room, I suppose *baselessly* you might end up on a floor that has yet to undergo renovations, so obviously don't quote me on that. We paid for the most affordable room nevertheless and were upgraded to a newer Club-floor room. 

I’m very lucky and grateful to have the opportunity to live in hotel(s) since 2013 from my teenage years until now as a young adult as someone from the middle-class. Before staying in New World, I stayed at Hotel Nikko Saigon for about a year. Nikko Saigon is owned by the Taiwanese Hotel Royal Group. My family moved to Vietnam with the Royal Group when they expanded a new location in Saigon under Nikko’s name. Compared to Nikko Saigon, New World Saigon has more history and heritage. Opened in 1996, New World was one of the first five-star hotels in HCMC. It has been a low-key but well-known city landmark that has seen the early economic boom of Vietnam. Furthermore, New World has managed to reinvent themselves to become more competitive against other newer 5-star hotels in the city after its renovations in 2019. Located at 76 Le Lai in District 1, across the 23/9 Park and next to Ben Thanh Market in what I call the heart of HCMC, the location of New World is convenient for anyone who wish to explore any parts of the city. 

Before attending University in the United States, I went to Saigon South International School (’18) in Phu My Hung, an urban development project in District 7 by the Taiwanese CT&D Group and HCMC’s People’s Committee since 1993. My commute time from New World to Phu My Hung was around 25 to 30 minutes depending on the traffic condition. Sometimes it would take over an hour with heavy congestion or bad weather. I used to study in the Starbucks at New World almost every day, which happened to be Vietnam’s first Starbucks location. After its business hours, I would head back to the hotel lounge to continue my study, sometimes until the next morning.

The life in Saigon has been pretty peaceful. The tropical sun and the people of Vietnam over time will turn you into a happier person without you even realizing it. I’m very lucky to be one of the few people in the world who were able to return to Vietnam during a global pandemic in October 2020 from Taiwan. I’m very proud of Vietnam and all the hard-working citizens who have laid a strong and robust foundation for the economical success Vietnam has today.
