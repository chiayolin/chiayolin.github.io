Elections under the framework of the ROC Constitution are just rotations of
political parties. The Formosan has the God-given right to alter and abolish
the ROC, a government which was forced upon the People of Formosa by the Allies
following the surrender of World War II. Formosan unite, Taiwan Independence or
death!

在既定的中華民國框架中的選舉，不過藍綠。我們需要的是推翻中華民國，驅逐這個台灣（二戰）戰敗後盟軍
強制台灣人接受的外來政權。台灣萬歲，福爾摩沙萬歲！
