Title: ROC Constitutional Court Interpretation #509

I'm writing this article just to document the event that happened recently and to 
provide my perspective of this particular incident.

Earlier this month, my friend, let's call him _Bob_, was warned that an allegation 
he made regarding accounting provision against a civil servant of Taiwan's _Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs_ could possibly constitute defamation. Such act is but a typical 
method and excuse the government officials constantly use to prevent the people from 
discussing and investigating the truth. Later on, he was even forced to answer 
questions asked by entities that are not entitled to the power to investigate. 
Conducting an investigation without the police power endowed by the Constitution is 
unconstitutional. Furthermore, the allegation he made is protected by the freedom of 
speech and is guaranteed by _Article 11_ of the Taiwanese (ROC) Constitution.

In the **[Constitutional Interpretation No. 509][ie]**（釋〔憲〕字第五〇九號）published 
in July 7th 2000, _Constitutional Court of Judicial Yuan_（司法院・憲法庭）reiterates 
the fact that the freedom of speech guaranteed by _Article 11_ is a fundamental right:

	「言論自由為人民之基本權利」

Thus the government is obligated to grant a maximum amount of protection for free 
speech: 

	「國家應給予最大限度之維護」

**No. 509** further states that as long as the person has reasonable 
grounds to believe that the statement is true, that person must be found not guilty of 
criminal defamation:

	「認為行為人有相當理由確信其為真實者，即不能以誹謗罪之刑責相繩」

The law of defamation is supposed to protect the reputation of a natural person but it 
is often abused by politicians so people will avoid discussing certain topics. This is 
wrong because a democratic institution is based upon open discussions and the system 
will fail to operate if the freedom of expression is taken away. Although there are 
_some people_ who want to sue _Bob_ for defamation, _Bob_ will not be found guilty
since his rights are protected by the Constitution and his situation is compatible with
**No. 509**. We shall view this incident as nothing more than an exercise of rights.
