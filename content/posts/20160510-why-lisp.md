Title: Why LISP?

A book would not become famous just because it is written in a popular
language. At the end of the day, ideas behind the words are what matter 
the most. The same concept apllies to programming languages, too. A good 
programming should be able to describe the abstract beings that inhabit 
a man's mind simply. By conjuring the recursive combinations made of simple 
primitives, LISP simplifies even the most complicated computational processes 
that inhabit a human's brain. Just like Bob Dylan's poems simplify the most
complex and obscure human emtion.
