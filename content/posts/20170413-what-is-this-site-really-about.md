Title: What is This Site Really About?

## A Domain Name

I purchased this domain name ([chiayolin.org](http://chiayolin.org)) in 2013. 
It was just few months after moving to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from Taiwan. 
I had no idea why I bought a domain name, but thought it would be a pretty cool 
project to work on. So I set up a simple web sever on my Raspberry Pi Model B,
tried pointing the domain to the Raspberry Pi server, but here was the problem — 
The hotel I lived in did not allow me to have a static external IP address. It 
was primarily because every room was sharing one external IP address. I asked 
the IT at the hotel whether it was possible to run a separate telephone line for 
me. He said the hotel would not let him rewire the telephone line in the room. 
I ended up setting up a web server that would only be accessible via the local 
network. However, this did not really bother me much since I just wanted a 
platform where I could experiment with different things.

## "What iz diz Chiayo?"

So that’s what this site is. A place where I experiment with different web 
development techniques. A place where I practice sharing thoughts. I like 
to document my thoughts the same way I write documentation for the code I have 
written. Sometimes, I would pick one and put it on this site. But most of the 
time, the ones I picked are the actual documentation of my code or the notes on
a project that I’m currently working on. 

Still don’t know what is going on here? That’s okay. This site fundamentally is
not for you, it’s for me. This is not a site that is meant to be read or seen 
by others. It was supposed to be private, only accessible to me on my LAN. 
You found this site on the internet is only because I bought a domain name, and
the source code is on Github so I might as well just host it on Github Pages.

Although this site is meant to be perosnal, I would like to hear about your 
thoughts, too. If you think something on the site is horribly wrong (not 
politically but technically), or you simply wanted to talk casually about 
computing science, let me know. My email and PGP public key is at the 
bottom right of this page. If you would like to, use PGP encryption to 
ensure and protect your privacy.
