Title: Continuity

This page is created in case for some reason I'm no longer able to keep my web 
services running and source code maintained.

I designate Ryo Budiwarman and be my virtual executor. Ryo has the authority to 
coordinate whatever actions are needed to dispatch my projects into safe hands
(And if you delete anything, Ryo, I will haunt you from the grave!).

<br/>
##### **Source code**
For my non-GPL source code should relicense under GPL. The the copyright for my
GPLed source code should revert to the Free Software Foundation and the humanity.

<br/>
##### **hearingvietnam.org**
The ownership of the website of Hearing Vietnam is to revert to Nirat Singh 
Rajpal, or with Nirat's consent to the new head of Hearing Vietnam or a third 
party agreeable to both.

<br/>
##### **chiayolin.org (chiayolin.github.io)**
Please keep my domain name and this website operational where possible, with 
content written by me kept untouched where appropriate. Appropriate pages 
(e.g. on chiayolin.org) may contain a notice about what happened with a link to 
more info. The front page of chiayolin.org should be redone as appropriate with 
a link to the old site.

<br/>
If I'm dead, I'd like be shipped home (Taiwan, please) and rest somewhere in 
[Yangmingshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangmingshan) near Taipei. 
I will miss you all :)
