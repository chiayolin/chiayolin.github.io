&lt;p&gt;I purchased this domain name (&lt;a href="http://chiayolin.org"&gt;chiayolin.org&lt;/a&gt;) in 2013. 
It was just few months after moving to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from Taiwan. 
I had no idea why I bought a domain name, but thought it would be a pretty cool 
project to work on. So I set up a simple web sever on my Raspberry Pi Model B,
tried pointing the domain to the Raspberry Pi server, but here was the problem — 
The hotel I lived in did not allow me to have a static external IP address. It 
was primarily because every room was sharing one external IP address. I asked 
the IT at the hotel whether it was possible to run a separate telephone line for 
me. He said the hotel would not let him rewire the telephone line in the room. 
I ended up setting up a web server that would only be accessible via the local 
network. However, this did not really bother me much since I just wanted a 
platform where I could experiment with different things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"What iz diz Chiayo?"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what this site is. A place where I experiment with different web 
development techniques. A place where I practice sharing thoughts. I like 
to document my thoughts the same way I write documentation for the code I have 
written. Sometimes, I would pick one and put it on this site. But most of the 
time, the ones I picked are the actual documentation of my code or the notes on
a project that I’m currently working on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still don’t know what is going on here? That’s okay. This site fundamentally is
not for you, it’s for me. This is not a site that is meant to be read or seen 
by others. It was supposed to be private, only accessible to me on my LAN. 
You found this site on the internet is only because I bought a domain name, and
the source code is on Github so I might as well just host it on Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this site is meant to be perosnal, I would like to hear about your 
thoughts, too. If you think something on the site is horribly wrong (not 
politically but technically), or you simply wanted to talk casually about 
computing science, let me know. My email and PGP public key is at the 
bottom right of this page. If you would like to, emails should use PGP 
encryption to ensure and protect your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>ROC Constitutional Court Interpretation #509</title><link href="/posts/roc-constitutional-court-interpretation-509/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-06T15:40:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-04-06T15:40:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chiayo Lin</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-04-06:/posts/roc-constitutional-court-interpretation-509/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this article just to document the event that happened recently and to

provide my perspective of this particular incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, my friend, let's call him &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;, was warned that an allegation 
he made regarding accounting provision against a civil servant of Taiwan's &lt;em&gt;Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs&lt;/em&gt; could possibly constitute defamation. Such act is but a typical 
method and excuse the government officials constantly use to prevent the people from 
discussing and investigating the truth. Later on, he was even forced to answer 
questions asked by entities that are not entitled to the power to investigate. 
Conducting an investigation without the police power endowed by the Constitution is 
unconstitutional. Furthermore, the allegation he made is protected by the freedom of 
speech and is guaranteed by &lt;em&gt;Article 11&lt;/em&gt; of the Taiwanese (ROC) Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/p03_01.asp?expno=509"&gt;Constitutional Interpretation No. 509&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;（釋〔憲〕字第五〇九號）published 
in July 7th 2000, &lt;em&gt;Constitutional Court of Judicial Yuan&lt;/em&gt;（司法院・憲法庭）reiterates 
the fact that the freedom of speech guaranteed by &lt;em&gt;Article 11&lt;/em&gt; is a fundamental right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;「言論自由為人民之基本權利」
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thus the government is obligated to grant a maximum amount of protection for free 
speech: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;「國家應給予最大限度之維護」
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 509&lt;/strong&gt; further states that as long as the person has reasonable 
grounds to believe that the statement is true, that person must be found not guilty of 
criminal defamation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;「認為行為人有相當理由確信其為真實者，即不能以誹謗罪之刑責相繩」
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The law of defamation is supposed to protect the reputation of a natural person but it 
is often abused by politicians so people will avoid discussing certain topics. This is 
wrong because a democratic institution is based upon open discussions and the system 
will fail to operate if the freedom of expression is taken away. Although there are 
&lt;em&gt;some people&lt;/em&gt; who want to sue &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt; for defamation, &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt; will not be found guilty
since his rights are protected by the Constitution and his situation is compatible with
&lt;strong&gt;No. 509&lt;/strong&gt;. We shall view this incident as nothing more than an exercise of rights.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Generating a Static Site with Pelican</title><link href="/posts/generating-a-static-site-with-pelican/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-19T19:27:01+08:00</published><updated>2016-07-19T19:27:01+08:00</updated><author><name>Chiayo Lin</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-07-19:/posts/generating-a-static-site-with-pelican/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; as a static site generator to generate HTML files from

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for this site and it worked just fine. However, Jekyll is perhaps
too powerful for what I really need. Because what I want is just a simple static 
site generator that generates my templates and Markdown files to HTML, without
spending time configuring different versions of Ruby Gems just to get my site up 
and running. So I recently decided to give &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; a try. Pelican is a 
static generator like Jekyll, but it is written in &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and uses 
&lt;a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/"&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; as its templating language/engine. This post is created as a note to
myself on generating a static site with Pelican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing we want to do is install Pelican and Markdown via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and update
your Python if it is needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pip install pelican markdown
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Create a Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pelican is installed on your machine, you may now begin creating a directory
for your Pelican site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ mkdir awsome_project 
$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; awsome_project
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After your project directory is created, run the &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; command to
proceed the process of creating a Pelican project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pelican-quickstart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By running &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt;, the script will ask you some questions regarding
the configuation of your site (this post will assume that you leave the choices 
as default). Answer these questions truthfully XD &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also want to initialize the project directory as a Git repository in
order to keep track of your code and later push them to &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.
(I will write another post on deploying a Pelican site to Github Pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/awsome_project.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Site Generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember any one of the Pelican commands... But hey, if you decided to
generate a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile"&gt;Makefile&lt;/a&gt; in the previous section when running the 
&lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; command then all you need to do now is run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make html
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's it. A Pelican site is generated under the &lt;code&gt;output/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Run a HTTP Server Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Running a HTTP Server Locally" is basically just a fancy way to say "preview your
site before publishing it." In order to do that, simply type the command below at
a terminal prompt inside your project's root directory (where your Makefile is):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ make serve
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, run &lt;code&gt;develop_server.sh&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sh develop_server.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will automatically regenerate the site when a change is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can navigate to &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/"&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/a&gt; in your browser 
to access/preview the generated site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writting Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Markdown file (or whatever tool you prefer) and other files for the site are
placed under the &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt; directory. For more information about writting the 
content, please head to the &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html"&gt;offical documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why LISP?</title><link href="/posts/why-lisp/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-10T19:30:30+08:00</published><updated>2016-05-10T19:30:30+08:00</updated><author><name>Chiayo Lin</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-05-10:/posts/why-lisp/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A book would not become famous just because it is written in a popular

You can find packages that haven't been officially supported by Arch Linux on AUR, 
such as Google Chrome, Dropbox, and Libre Office. AUR contains package descriptions 
(PKGBUILDs) that allow you to compile a package from source with makepkg and then 
install it via pacman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install build essentials: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pacman -S --needed base-devel
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the built essentials are installed, download the tarball of the package that 
you want from &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/"&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;. And switch your current working directory to where the 
tarball is at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/directory/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Simply extract the tarball using the &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ tar -zxvf FOOBAR.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the extracted folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/FOOBAR/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Make the package using &lt;code&gt;makepkg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ makepkg -Acs
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do not run makepkg as root!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, install the package with the extension &lt;code&gt;.pkg.tar.xz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pacman -U FOOBAR.pkg.tar.xz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And then you are ready to go :D&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
