						<h3>What is The Internet?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Internet is a computer network consisting of a worldwide network of computer networks that use the TCP/IP network protocols to facilitate data transmission and exchange. Basically it means,<b> every user on the Internet is a node, without a central governing system.</b></p>

						<h3>Internet Freedom</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Internet freedom is considered as one of basic human rights by United Nations. Therefore, every humans has the right to access Internet freely. However, some governments are taking away the Internet freedom from their people by creating those unreasonable policies, acts, or agreements. For example, <a href="#SOPA">SOPA</a>, <a href="#TPP">TPP</a>, and <a href="#Golden Shield Project">Golden Shield Project</a>.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallowing four principles are the core ideas of the Internet freedom:</p>
					<ul class="default">
						<li>Governments do not have the right to censor the Internet.</li>
						<li>Keep Internet an open network where everyone is free to connect.</li>
						<li>Protect the freedom to innovate and create without permission.</li>
						<li>Protect privacy and defend everyone’s ability to control how their data and devices are used.</li>

						<h3>Why is Internet freedom considered<br/>a basic human right?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Internet freedom should be considered a basic right because, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, everybody has the right to access information and communicate freely, whether they are online or offline.</p>

				<!-- START: SOPA -->
				<section id="SOPA">
					<header>
						<h3>SOPA <a href="#Internet Freedom">&#x21e1;</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) would allow US government devise a list of website that US citizen weren't allow to visit. It is an online censorship in North America, just like a Chinese-Style firewall.</p> 
					<blockquote>If we lost the ability to communicate with each other over the internet, it would be a change of Bill of Rights...... - Aaron  Swartz</blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act allows US government shutdown website whenever they think there are some "anti-copyrights" things on it. Such as, Torrent servers and Wikileaks. It has violated Internet freedom because it stopped humans connect with certain groups on Internet. And it is an Act to censor the Internet</p>
					<blockquote>New technology should bring us greater freedom...... - Aaron  Swartz</blockquote>

				<!-- END: SOPA -->
				<!-- START: TPP -->
				<section id="TPP">
					<header>
						<h3>TPP <a href="#Internet Freedom">&#x21e1;</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement) is a trade agreement across 12 countries: <i>Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, United States, Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, and Japan.</i></p>
					<blockquote>Under  this TPP proposal, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could be required to "police" user activity (i.e. police YOU), take down internet content, and cut people off from internet access for common user-generated content.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>Breaking digital locks (DRM) for legit purposes, such as using Linux, could subject users to mandatory fines.</blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement has violated internet freedom because it doesn't protect the freedom to innovate, and they just extended copyrights and fined people instead. And it also decreased the ability to connect with people over Internet, because it allows ISPs to supervise you and cut you from internet, which is violating one of the core ideas of internet freedom, <i>"Keep Internet an open network where everyone is free to connect."</i></p>
				</section>
				<!-- END: TPP -->
				<!-- START: Golden Shield Project -->
				<section id="Golden Shield Project">

						<h3>Golden Shield Project <a href="#Internet Freedom">&#x21e1;</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>Golden Shield Project is a Internet censorship and surveillance project operated by Chinese government in 2003.
					<blockquote>The Golden Shield. Ultimately, the aim is to integrate a gigantic online database with an all-encompassing surveillance network – incorporating speech and face recognition, closed-circuit television, smart cards, credit records, and Internet surveillance technologies</blockquote></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some methods that Golden Shield Project is using to censor the Internet are:<br/></p>

								<tr>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Shield Project has violated Internet freedom because this project is basically violated all the rights that guarantee by the Internet Freedom. Such as, right to not be censor by governments, keep internet an open network, and etc.</p>
