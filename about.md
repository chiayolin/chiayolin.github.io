I’m a student at [SSIS][1]. My primary responsibility is to complete homework from school everyday
(which I never did. . . oops). I am passionate about everything that relates to the science of 
computation (AKA computer science). Anyway, this site is full of trash-talk, but maybe you 
will find something useful. If you’re interested in stuffs that I’m doing (which you probably 
won’t), go take a look at my [Gihub][2] :)
