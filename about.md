I’m a student in SSIS. My primary responsibility is to complete homework from school everyday
(which I never did.... oops). I am passionate about everything that relates to the science of 
computation (AKA computer science). Anyway, this site is full trash talks, but maybe you 
will find something useful. If you’re interested in stuffs that I’m doing (which you probably 
won’t), go take a look at my [Gihub](https://github.com/chiayolin/) :)
